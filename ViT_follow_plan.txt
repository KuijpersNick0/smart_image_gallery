Yes, achieving person re-identification across user-uploaded images involves training a model to extract features that are robust and discriminative across different instances of the same person. Vision transformers can indeed be used for this task. Here's a general approach to achieve person re-identification in your application:

Data Preparation:

Collect a dataset with images of persons from multiple camera views or instances. Each person should have multiple images associated with them.
Annotate the dataset with person IDs to indicate the identity of each person.
Model Training:

Use a vision transformer architecture for person re-identification. You can use pre-trained models or train a vision transformer from scratch on your annotated dataset.
During training, use a loss function that encourages the model to learn discriminative features for each person. Common loss functions for person re-identification include triplet loss or contrastive loss.
Feature Extraction:

After training, use the trained vision transformer model to extract features from images. The features should capture the unique characteristics of each person.
Person Matching:

When a user uploads a new image, extract features using the trained model.
Compare the extracted features with the features of persons already present in your database.
If the similarity between the features is above a certain threshold, label the person in the uploaded image with the same ID as the matching person in the database.
Threshold Tuning:

The threshold for similarity comparison is a crucial parameter. You may need to experimentally determine a suitable threshold based on the characteristics of your data and the desired trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
Incremental Learning (Optional):

If your application allows for continuous learning, you can periodically update the model with new user-uploaded images to improve re-identification accuracy over time.
Handling New Persons:

Implement a mechanism to handle new persons not present in the database. This could involve adding their features to the database with a new ID or periodically retraining the model with new data.
User Feedback (Optional):

Consider incorporating user feedback to improve the accuracy of person re-identification. For example, users could provide corrections if the system misidentifies a person.
Deployment:

Deploy the trained model and associated components in your application for real-time person re-identification.
Keep in mind that the success of person re-identification depends on the quality and diversity of your training data, the effectiveness of your chosen vision transformer architecture, and the tuning of hyperparameters such as the similarity threshold.
